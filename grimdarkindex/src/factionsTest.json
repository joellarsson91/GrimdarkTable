The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re‐rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side – this is your Miracle dice pool.\nPerforming an Act of Faith\nBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are apart of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:\n\n■ Advance roll\n■ Battle-shock test\n■ Charge roll\n■ Damage roll\n■ Hit roll\n■ Saving throw\n■ Wound roll\n***Example:** Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a Battle-shock test for a unit, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 4, the unit’s Battle-shock test would be determined by rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would be D6+4).*"
